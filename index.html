        <h1>What is JavaScript?</h1>
        <p>The JavaScript programming language is text-based and can be used on both client and server-side. It controls multimedia within web pages and allows them to become interactive. JavaScript empowers a developer to do many things like adding animation to images or updating content automatically on a page. JavaScript is what allows you to interact with the vast majority of web pages that you visit. Whether it’s filling out forms, scrolling through maps, or registering for an event, it’s most likely that JavaScript programming is what’s allowing you to do it. 
        </p>
        <p>JavaScript is among the world’s most used programming languages. Without it, we’d be looking at pages that do nothing other than display images and text. HTML may be the bones of a web page, and CSS adds style, but JavaScript programming is what gives it life.</p>
        <p>JavaScript programming isn’t just useful to standard websites. JavaScript is also responsible for most in-browser games, great for killing a bit of time or for honing your skills if you are just starting off in development.

            JavaScript is a dynamic computer programming language. It is lightweight and most commonly used as a part of web pages, whose implementations allow client-side script to interact with the user and make dynamic pages. It is an interpreted programming language with object-oriented capabilities.
            <br>

            JavaScript was first known as LiveScript, but Netscape changed its name to JavaScript, possibly because of the excitement being generated by Java. JavaScript made its first appearance in Netscape 2.0 in 1995 with the name LiveScript. The general-purpose core of the language has been embedded in Netscape, Internet Explorer, and other web browsers.
